Hi! I am a master student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) (LTI, Master's of Computational Data Science), advised by [Daphne Ippolito](https://www.daphnei.com/).

My Research interests lie in these topics:
- Enhance the ability of LLMs to follow diverse writing styles
- Understand how parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g. LoRA) steers the direction of LLM training
- Improve LLMs through advanced tool-using capabilities

Prior to CMU, I graduated as the Outstanding Graduate of Beijing from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) with a B.E. in Computer Science.
