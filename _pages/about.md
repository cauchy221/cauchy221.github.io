Hi! I am a master student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) (LTI, Master's of Computational Data Science). I am fortunate to have to opportunity to work with amazing researchers including [Daphne Ippolito](https://www.daphnei.com/), [Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io/), and [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/).

I am interested in making language models more efficient and adaptive, serving diverse human needs and values while operating under practical constraints of limited training data and computational resources. I am especially interested in making language models better in creative writing domains.

Prior to CMU, I graduated as the Outstanding Graduate of Beijing from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) with a B.E. in Computer Science.

In my free time, I enjoy visiting coffee shops in Pittsburgh. I also do indoor bouldering twice a week (still V1-V2 level).
