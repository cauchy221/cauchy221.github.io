Hi! I am a master student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) (LTI, Master's of Computational Data Science). I am doing independent study with [Daphne Ippolito](https://www.daphnei.com/) on style-following generation. I am also working with [Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/) on tool induction for coding agent.

Prior to CMU, I graduated as the Outstanding Graduate of Beijing from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) with a B.E. in Computer Science.
